Akademik is the second php homework project for CIT 313: Web Programming II. This project emphasizes the use of arrays, PHP session variables, and functions. 

##Project Description

"For your second PHP project, you will be creating a list that simulates the courses you must take in order to graduate (you can test with a small subset of courses). You will need to create a single page application that will allow a user to add courses to this list (HINT: store as a PHP Session variable) and then add the ability to mark courses as completed. When a course is marked as completed, you need to store the grade received in the course and change the course listing's CSS for this course (think CSS class) to italics and gray text. You should store your list of courses as an array (and remember, arrays can be added to session variables). Nothing says you are limited to a single array either (grades), but extra credit given for a single array. The list of courses will also display the student's GPA for those courses completed (assume the same # of credit hours for each course). For the GPA, store it as a cookie that gets calculated only when the course is marked as completed and a grade entered (think form submission to change up your sessions and cookies). Use and modify a Bootstrap template.
